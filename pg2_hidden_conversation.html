What occurred was </p>
<p class="visable"> not my fault, no not that. 
Accidental? ummm </p>
unintentional, completely
regrettable. And I am truly sorry that you took
it the way you did, that you interpreted my 
words in that way… no use ‘I’ language if I
offended any of you at all. I don’t expect to be 
forgiven for the things I said and did regarding 
that particular group of people, wait that might 
sound wrong, but I am here to say sorry. Now a
promise but, Will it happen again? I don’t know
that I can promise that. What I can do is 
promise to try to be better in the public eye- no 
vaguer, work on being better, observing myself
and trying my best to improve upon myself. Be 
strong you got it, I am taking all accountability
and responsibility for these actions. I have tried 
to act in a way that would make those around 
me proud, but I failed on that day, wait no then
shouldn’t put a time stamp on this. I thought 
I was doing well. But now I am aware of the extent 
of the impact of my actions. I said to myself what
I did was okay, no no no - It was not okay for 
me to do these things. What can I say so they know
I am sorry? There is nothing here I will forgive
myself for, and I don’t expect to be forgiven, 
but I hope we can move past this.
